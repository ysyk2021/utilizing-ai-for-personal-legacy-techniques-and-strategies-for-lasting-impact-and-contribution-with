========================================================================================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore some of the tools and platforms available for individuals to create and contribute to AI-enabled personal legacies.

Digital Curation and Preservation Tools
---------------------------------------

Digital curation and preservation tools such as ArchiveBox and Nostalgia can help individuals organize and preserve their digital content. These tools can automatically save web pages, social media posts, and other online content for offline access, ensuring that important information and memories are not lost over time.

Content Creation Tools
----------------------

Content creation tools such as Artbreeder and Inscribe use AI algorithms to generate or enhance digital content. Artbreeder is an AI-powered image generator that allows users to create new, unique images by mixing and matching existing ones. Inscribe, on the other hand, uses natural language processing to suggest alternative phrasing or wording for text-based content.

AI-Powered Artifact Design and Production Tools
-----------------------------------------------

AI-powered artifact design and production tools such as Ashes to Diamonds and The Living Urn enable individuals to create lasting physical artifacts that reflect their personal legacies. Ashes to Diamonds, for example, uses high-pressure and high-temperature techniques to transform carbon extracted from a person's ashes into a diamond. The Living Urn provides biodegradable urns that contain a special soil mixture and a tree seed, allowing individuals to create a living memorial that grows into a tree.
